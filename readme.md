Description
===========

This little Chef Cookbook provides recipes and definitions to install Splunk Forwarders and setup monitors for Splunk Storm.

As you know, Splunk Storm uses a proprietary credentials file to setup access to the Splunk Storm servers/account.
You probably won't want to have this file floating around in your cookbook unencrypted, so we're going to stuff the contents of the credentials file into a Secure Databag.

To do that, you'll need to:

1. Create the data bag using knife
        
        knife data bag create licenses storm --secret-file ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
2. Open `irb` from the directory containing your project certificate, and run the following script (make sure you update the variables to suit your setup)

        require 'base64'
        require 'chef'

        data_bag     = "licenses"
        data_bag_key = "storm"
        license_file = "stormforwarder_XXXXXXXX.spl"
         
        data = [File.open(license_file, "rb") {|io| io.read}].pack("m")
3. Copy the string output by `irb`, and run the following command to edit the data bag, pasting the string into a JSON "data" field, and the license filename into a "filename" field.

        knife data bag edit licenses storm --secret-file ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret

4. Run `knife data bag show licenses storm --secret-file ~/.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret` and confirm your data bag looks like something like this:

        {
            "id": "storm",
            "filename": "stormforwarder_XXXXXXXX.spl",
            "data": "string created in irb"
        }
3. You'll probably want to check-in your databag into your SCM
        
        knife data bag show licenses storm -Fj > data_bags/licenses/storm.json
